# CS79995-Assignment4
Convolution Algorithm in CUDA

The program is written in three different memory management. 
 
1) Naive algorithm which is a straight forward one without any memory management. 
2) Algorithm using shared memory which takes advantage of shared memory. 
2) Algorithm using constant memory.
